	Author: Roman Kuzmin

LONG DESCRIPTION
	Though this module is designed for Far Manager it does not depend on Far or
	FarNet, it works in any PowerShell host (e.g. in Console or ISE hosts).

	It still uses Far Manager description settings from the registry:
	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far2\Descriptions

EXPORTED COMMANDS
	-- Update-FarDescription (cmdlet)
	-- Update-FarDescriptionSynopsis (function)

EXTENDED TYPES
	The module adds a few members to the [System.IO.FileSystemInfo] items
	(files or directories, items of the FileSystem provider).

	=================================================================

	[System.IO.FileSystemInfo]
	(files and directories)

	FarDescription property
		Gets or sets the item description. Description is deleted if it is
		empty. Empty description files are also deleted.
